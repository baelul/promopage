      <p>Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club,
        high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his days at either the clubroom or
        the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this
        leisurely lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly
         encounters a cursed item. Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences,
        Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful
        beings formed from human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said
        item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the
         "King of Curses." Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses
         pose to society as he discovers his own newfound powers. Introduced to
         the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, he begins to walk
          down a path from which he cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer.</p>

      <p>Essentially, kid eats a crusty cursed finger and is forced to be a jujutsu
      sorcerer.</p>
